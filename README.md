Book List Management application

Description:
This application is designed to allow the user (in this case, probably just me, although maybe other GoodReads members would like this) to create a customizable "reading challenge" list consisting of several criteria, with books capable of fulfilling multiple criteria -- or a single criterion being fulfilled by many books.

The origin of this project came from reading challenges on GoodReads.com -- specifically this Popsugar Reading Challenge (http://www.popsugar.com/love/Reading-Challenge-2015-36071458) and the Book Riot Read Harder challenge (http://bookriot.com/2014/12/15/book-riot-2015-read-harder-challenge/) 

Feature list:
  - Needs to support rapid reassignment of books.
  - Many-to-many relationships
  - Login functionality.

This project will be built in Meteor. Pull requests welcome!
